# Web Scraping and Analysis of Football Data from FBref
## Project Objective
In this project we try to create a database with different stats that we get from the website FBREF. To achieve that goal, we did a code in which we use webscraping to download the data from the top 5 european leagues. After that we develop different functions to make an analysis of goalkeepers and about the competitiveness.

## Overview
In this project, we have successfully written scripts to scrape data from FBref. With the data gathered, we took the opportunity to analyze several parameters, including:
+ **Competitiveness:** A comparative analysis of different leagues.
+ **Goalkeeper Analysis:** An in-depth analysis of goalkeepers from thr leagues.

## Methodology
1. Web Scraping
   * Using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, we scraped the necessary data from FBref.
2. Data Cleaning and Processing
   * The scraped data was cleaned and processed for analysis.
3. Data analysis
   * Using tools such as pandas and matplotlib, we conducted various analyses on the data.

## Findings
### Competitiveness Analysis
We analyzed the competitiveness of different football leagues based on several metrics such as:
* Points distribution
* Goal differences
* Match outcomes
### Goalkeeper Analysis
An in-depth analysis of goalkeeper performance across different leagues was conducted, focusing on metrics such as:
* Save percentages
* Clean sheets
* Goals conceded

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced our web scraping skills but also allowed us to delve deeper into football statistics, combining our passion for football with our growing expertise in data science.

## Future Work
1. Expand the scope of analysis to include more leagues and seasons.
2. Implement machine learning models to predict future performance based on historical data.
3. Develop a web application to display our findings in an interactive manner.
